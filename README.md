# Excel-Road-Accident-Analysis
I recently completed a comprehensive analysis of road accident data using advanced data processing and visualization techniques. Here's an overview of the steps involved in this project:

Data Cleaning and Organization: I started by thoroughly examining the raw data for inconsistencies and irrelevant information. This involved removing duplicate entries, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats to ensure uniformity.

Advanced Data Analysis: I applied complex formulas for statistical and trend analysis. This helped in understanding patterns like peak accident times and assessing correlations between different factors, such as weather conditions and accident rates.

Dynamic Dashboard Creation with Pivot Tables: I transformed the processed data into pivot tables, allowing for an interactive exploration of various aspects of the data. The final step was designing a dynamic dashboard, incorporating user-friendly interfaces and visualization tools like charts and maps. This dashboard highlights key trends and potential accident hotspots, providing clear and actionable insights.

Through this process, I was able to present the road accident data in a clear, accurate, and insightful manner, making it an invaluable resource for informed decision-making and policy development.
